                The complete density bottle with stopper shall be dried at 105
                to 110Â°C, cooled in the desiccator and weighed to the nearest
                0.001 g (m1).

                The 50 g sample obtained as described in the procedure for the
                preparation of disturbed samples for testing shall, if
                necessary, be ground to pass a 2-mm IS test sieve.

                A 5 to 10 g subsample shall be obtained by riffling, and
                oven-dried at 105 to 1100 C.
              </li>
              <li>
                This sample shall be transferred to the density bottle direct
                from the desiccator in which it has been cooled.
              </li>
              <li>
                The bottle and contents together with the stopper shall be
                weighed to the nearest 0.001 g (m2).
              </li>
              <li>
                The stoppered bottle shall then be taken out of the bath, wiped
                dry and the whole weighed to the nearest 0.001 g (m3).

                The bottle shall then be taken out of the bath, wiped dry and

                Two determinations of the specific gravity of the same soils
