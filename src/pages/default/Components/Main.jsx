        <hr />
        <p>CA water tank or container should do no harm to the water. Water is susceptible to a number of 
          ambient negative influences, including bacteria, viruses, algae, changes in pH, and accumulation
          of minerals, accumulated gas. The contamination can come from a variety of origins including piping,
          tank construction materials, animal and bird feces, mineral and gas intrusion. A correctly designed
          water tank works to address and mitigate these negative effects.It is imperative that water tanks
          be cleaned annually to preclude delivery of algae, bacteria and viruses to people or animals.</p>
